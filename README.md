Convert Basecamp tasks with due dates to Calendar events and TODOs

Overview
---

Another bookmarklet, this one lets you take any [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) tasks in your task list and creates
either iCalendar calendar events, or TODO events (similar to what Apple Reminders use). It's terribly rough around the
edges, but so far seems to work.

Installation
---

The built file in the `build` folder can be copy/pasted into a bookmarklet in your browser of choice.
